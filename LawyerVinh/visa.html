      <h1> Visas</h1>
  
<h3> Utah Immigration Visa Lawyer </h3>
<p> At the Salt Lake City Law Office of Vinh K. Ly, Attorney & Counselor at Law, I work specifically with individuals who have legal needs having to do with immigration law. If you are coming to the US – whether to study, work, run a business, or be near family – you want to make sure that you work with an immigration visa lawyer who can best advise you so that paperwork is handled accurately and deadlines are met. </p>

<p> If you are interested in finding out more how I can help, contact Utah immigraton visa lawyer Vinh K. Ly today. </p>
<h3> Student Visas</h3>

<p> Student visas, also called F-1s, M-1s, or J-1s, are relatively easy to obtain if you have been accepted into a school program as an exchange student. If you are not a U.S. resident, but have obtained a visa that allows you to receive an education in the United States, call me to discuss your options before you obtain your degree. I have assisted minors who have obtained citizenship through adoption if they qualify, as well as students who have obtained jobs and are seeking sponsorship with a hiring company. </p>

<h3> Work Visas</h3>

<p> If you have specific skills related to business management, computers, technology, cooking, or religious work, a company or organization may wish to sponsor you on an H-1, L-1, E-1 work visa, or labor certification process. I work with both petitioning companies and non-resident potential employees to hire or maintain the employees they value through Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) applications. I also keep individuals apprised of deadlines and paperwork that must be filed. </p>

<h3> Family Visas</h3>

<p> If you are a legal resident in this country and want to be reunited with your immediate family members such as spouses, parents, siblings, or children, by bringing them to the US, you will need the assistance of a lawyer who not only knows immigration law, but who understands your situation and the need to keep family together. I have had successful experiences helping people wishing to sponsor family members who are not in the US obtain K-visas so they can emigrate. </p>

<p> I also assist people who have fiancées outside the country and wish to learn more about K-1 visas. </p>

<h3> Other</h3>

<p> Perhaps you have entered the country illegally and need a lawyer who can help you with your Entry Without Inspections (EWI) hearing so that you can adjust your status. Maybe you are escaping persecution in another country and are seeking asylum in the US. When you make an appointment to see me, I can help you prepare to go before the hearing officer or an immigration judge so that you may be offered temporary status. </p>

<p> Contact me, Utah immigration visa lawyer Vinh K. Ly, to get the effective help you need in a positive and encouraging environment. </p>
