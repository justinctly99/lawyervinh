      <h1> Green Card</h1>
	  <h3> Salt Lake City Immigration, Personal Injury, and Criminal Defense Law Firm</h3>
      <p>At the Law Office of Vinh K. Ly, Attorney & Counselor at Law, no immigration case is too small. I work with clients from all walks of life—students, scholars, specialized workers, business owners, investors, asylees, religious workers, and individuals with extraordinary abilities in business, science, education, athletics, or arts—providing clear, confident, and positive advice and legal service related to their immigration law situations. Below are some frequently asked questions. For more specific questions feel free to <a href="contact_us.html" class="btn"> contact me. </a><br><br>
  
<h3>Utah Green Card Attorney</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, in order to get a green card to stay in the United States, you first need to obtain a visa. Quite often, filling out paperwork, meeting deadlines, and determining how long your green card is valid for can be either overwhelming or confusing. This is why it is best to work with an attorney who focuses his attention solely on helping visitors in the United States obtain visas, green cards, and ultimately, citizenship. </p>
<p>Contact Utah green card attorney Vinh K. Ly today to schedule an initial consultation. </p>

<h3>Visas</h3>
<p>Having a visa is the first step to obtaining a green card. You may have obtained a temporary visa:<br>
<ul>
<li> as a student </li>
<li> as a worker</li>

<li> through a sponsoring family member. </li>

</ul>
<p> However, if you want to take the next step, you need to be aware both of filing deadlines as well as those pertaining to renewal. While L and H work related visas generally cover six years (over two three-year periods), it is better to obtain a green card. I have worked extensively with individuals wanting green cards – I know the immigration system and can make your process run more smoothly by keeping you informed of important deadlines. </p>
<p> For example, you may not be aware, but your first green card is only valid for two years if your green card is a merit based petition. I will help you complete paperwork and make sure that you understand the compliance guidelines so that you have no problems. </p>
<p> If you have entered this country without a visa – either as an illegal alien or for humanitarian reasons such as asylum – the processes are somewhat different, but you must apply within a year of your arrival, unless you fit under certain exceptions. On the other hand, if you have come to this country illegally and wish to obtain a green card without a visa, you must prove ten years of residency. If successfully proven, and you meet other conditions, you will receive a green card. </p>
<p> Having come to this country from Vietnam, I am aware of the challenges of obtaining a green card and want to ease the process for others. Contact me, Vinh K. Ly, green card lawyer today – I will provide you with the knowledge and positive outlook you need to achieve your goals in this country. </p>
